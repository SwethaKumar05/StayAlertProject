# StayAlertProject
StayAlert is a machine learning model designed to enhance driver safety by providing real-time alerts during driving sessions.Leveraging logistic regression and ensemble techniques including AdaBoost, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, the model assesses driver alertness based on various features derived from extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection processes. By employing confusion matrix analysis, StayAlert offers accurate notifications to prompt drivers when they need to stay vigilant, contributing to safer journeys on the road.
